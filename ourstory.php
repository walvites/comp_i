		<h2 class="who">How We Began</h2> 
			<p>The conception of MentorMeet began in the Winter of 2015. I decided to begin this project
			because I realized that transitioning isn't easy. When I first started my transition, I had no one to talk to. It became a very lonely life changing process, and many of us are the first in our social circles to transition. Transitioning involves a lot of inqueries and concerns, especially if you have no other trans individuals to talk to. Therefore, I decided to create MentorMeet to connect transmen who have gotten far in their transition to help those who are starting out.

		<p>All of our brothers have been where you are. They, too, had ample amount of questions, questions that involved medical, surgical, and social transitioning. This journey can have its hard days, but that's why we have each other. I have provided this platform for other to lean onto one another in those times of needs.
